# AD-HOC-Analysis
This is a Data Analytics project I have done using SQL for query and power bi for visualization as part of the Codebasics SQL Project Challenge.

In this project, I have used tools like:

1) 𝐌𝐲𝐒𝐐𝐋 - to query the database
2) 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐈 - to visualize the data
3) Canva - to present the Insights

Some of the important learnings from this project are:

1. Applying many important SQL concepts like Subqueries, Multiple joins, CTE, Window functions, etc. to query the database for a meaningful business scenario.

2. Using a custom visual called "dumbbell chart" in Power BI, to visualize the difference between any two variables effectively. Thanks to Yuki Kakegawa for sharing the dumbbell chart.

3. Exploring various features in PowerPoint to make the presentation effective.
